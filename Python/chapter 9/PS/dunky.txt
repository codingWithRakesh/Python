Title: The Clever Donkey

Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a farmer who owned a very stubborn XXXXXX named Balu. Every morning, Balu refused to move until he had his favorite snack — a carrot. The farmer, tired of begging, had an idea. He tied a stick to Balu’s head with a carrot hanging in front of his nose.

Thinking he was about to reach the carrot, Balu started walking — faster than ever! The villagers laughed and clapped, saying, “That’s not a lazy XXXXXX, that’s a clever one!”

But only Balu knew — he enjoyed the game. He was getting his exercise and his carrot every time. Who was the clever one now?
